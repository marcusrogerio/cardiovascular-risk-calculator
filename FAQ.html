		<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
		<h2>What does this calculator do?</h2>
		<p>This cardiovascular risk calculator provides you with an interactive and individualized tool that provides an absolute estimate (%) of a person's chance of having a cardiovascular event (CVD or CHD, or heart attacks or strokes) over a specific period of time and an idea of the potential benefit of treatment. It is only valid for people who have never had a cardiovascular event.</p>
		<p>This calculator was designed to dynamically show how the value of specific risk factors impact cardiovascular risk. Results are shown using a representation of 100 "happy faces" to help illustrate risk as this format seems to be one of the better ways to visually present risks. Absolute numbers are also provided and rounded off to one decimal point even though <b>any cardiovascular estimates likely are +/- 5-10% at best.&nbsp;</b></p>
		
		<h1>How do I use the Cardiovascular Risk/Benefit Calculator?</h1>
		
		<h3>1) Enter the unmodifiable factors</h3>
		<p>These are the factors that really can't be changed.</p>
		
		<h4>ENTER</h4>
		<p>a) the time period of the risk estimate in years</p>
		<p>b) the age in years</p>
		<p>c) the gender</p>
		
		<h3>2) Enter the modifiable factors</h3>
		<p>These are factors that can potentially be modified with lifestyle changes or medications.</p>
		
		<h4>ENTER</h4>
		<p>a) smoking status - yes or no</p>
		<p>b) diabetes - yes or no&nbsp;</p>
		<p>c) systolic blood pressure in mmHg - the calculator uses 120mm/Hg to calculate baseline risk</p>
		<p>d) total cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 4 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
		<p>d) HDL&nbsp;cholesterol in mmol/L - the calculator uses 1 mmol/L to calculate baseline risk</p>
		
		<h3>3) Estimate benefit</h3>
		<p>Estimate of benefit - enter any relative benefit and this will be applied to the absolute risk to calculate the % of people who could benefit from a therapy. Examples of relative benefits taken from a synopsis of the best available evidence - typically either RCT or meta-analyses - are provided.&nbsp;</p>
		
		<h3><a name="tweak"></a>4) Calculator tweak</h3>
		<p>The calculator can be tweaked to take into account concerns that in some populations the Framingham database appears to over-estimate risk. Some studies have suggested Framingham data overestimates CHD risk - a German cohort (50% overestimate), British cohort (57% overestimate), Chinese cohort (2-3 times overestimate). Although, some studies from North America show Framimgham provides a reasonable estimate. Adjust the overall risk up or down as desired. These are non-Framingham sanctioned changes.</p>
		
		<h3>CHOOSE OUTCOMES</h3>
		<p>Clicking on the CVD, CHD, heart attack, or stroke tabs will change the risk estimate to reflect these specific outcomes. The pictures below the happy faces show the specific outcomes included in the definitions of CVD and CHD.</p>
		
		<h3><a name="percentage"></a>ABSOLUTE NUMBERS - calculated risk and benefits</h3>
		<p>a)&nbsp;<strong>NO EVENTS</strong> is the % of people who would NOT have an event over the selected time period</p>
		<div><p>b) <strong>BASELINE&nbsp;EVENTS</strong> is the % of people who would have an event if they had "baseline" risk factors (non-smoker, non-diabetic, SBP = 120, Total cholesterol = 4, HDL = 1.3)</p>
		<p>c) <strong>ADDITIONAL EVENTS</strong> is the % of people who would have an event <strong>OVER AND ABOVE</strong> the baseline rate and is that risk attributable to the persons specific risk factors</p>
		<p>d)&nbsp;<strong>BENEFITS&nbsp;</strong>is the % of people who would not have an event because of "treatment" and is based on reducing the absolute risk by the relative estimate of benefit</p>
	</div><h1>Where do the numbers in the calculator come from?</h1><p>This calculator uses data taken from <a href="http://cvrisk.mvm.ed.ac.uk/calculator/excelcalc.htm">http://cvrisk.mvm.ed.ac.uk/calculator/excelcalc.htm</a> which is based on the Framingham database.</p>
		<p>
		<a name="benefit"></a></p>
		<h1>Where do the estimates of benefit come from?</h1><p>The table below includes a reasonable estimate of the relative benefits of certain "therapies" and comes from a variety of meta-analyses and studies. One can apply these numbers to the individual patients absolute risk using the "Relative benefit" slider. This provides a reasonable estimate of the potential benefit of treatment.</p>

		<h1>Why aren't surrogate marker or treatment thresholds provided?</h1>
		<p>You will notice there are no designated target or treatment thresholds from guidelines. These were purposely not added as they are arbitrary and one should use a reasonable estimate of risks and benefits to help facilitate shared-informed decision-making.</p>
		
		<h1>Diabetes and smoking aren't really yes or no risk factors, what gives?</h1>
		
		<a name="smoking"></a>
		
		<h3>Smoking</h3>
		<p>Smoking history is, as ascertained in Framingham, based on self-report. It is unclear exactly what should constitute a smoker. What seems reasonable is that if a person has been a smoker over the last 5 years they should be considered a smoker. If they stopped smoking 5-10 years ago they should likley be considered a non-smoker for the purposes of cardiovascular risk calculation. However, it is important to remember that smoking also increases the risks for cancers and lung disease and these risks may not be as reversible when a person becomes a non-smoker.
		</p>
		
		<a name="diabetes"></a>
		
		<h3>Diabetes</h3>
		<p>Many cardiovascular risk calculators identify diabetes as a yes or no variable. Framingham defines diabetes as a fasting glucose of &gt; 7mmol/L (126 mg/dL) for the offspring cohort or 7.8 (140) for the original cohort. It is clear however that diabetes is not a yes or no risk factor. Based on the UKPDS risk engine for every 2% increase in A1c, over 6%CVD risk goes up 33%. Type-2 diabetes also increases the chance of microvascular disease. Compared to macrovascular risks the absolute risk of hard microvascular endpoints like renal failure or blindness are far less frequent. However incidence data is not as robust for these endpoints. In UKPDS 34 less than 1% of patients developed renal failure over 11 years and roughly 5% developed blindness in one eye. In STENO, in which patients also had microalbuminuria, 8% of patients in the standard treatment group went on dialysis and 9% became blind in at least 1 eye over 14 years. Vijan et al estimated a 60-year-old diabetic with an A1c of 9% has a lifetime chance of dialysis of around 1 in 100 and a similar lifetime chance of blindness.</p>
		
		<h1>Why aren't risk factors like family history and lifestyle included in the calculator?</h1>
		<p>Framingham calculators use age, gender, SBP, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking and diabetes to calculate cardiovascular risk. Adjustments for family history, weight, BMI etc are not available from Framingham calculators.</p>
		
		<h3>Family history suggestions</h3>
		
		<p>The joint British societies suggest that a positive family history is typically defined as a history of CHD or other atherosclerotic vascular disease at an early age - men &lt;55 years, women &lt;65 years. Studies suggest family history increases risk by 1.3 to 2x. While not often mentioned, if a person does not have a family history of CHD then in theory risk estimates should be decreased.</p>
		
		<a name="framingham"></a>
		<h1>What specific outcomes do the cardiovascular terms include and how are they defined?</h1>
		
		<h3>Angina</h3>
		<p>A brief recurrent chest discomfort of up to 15 minutes duration, precipitated by exertion or emotion and relieved by rest or by nitroglycerine AND coronary insufficiency = prolonged (&gt;15 minutes) chest pain but no indication of heart tissue damage.</p>
		
		<a name="chd"></a>
		
		<h3>Coronary heart disease (CHD)</h3>
		<p>CHD = fatal/non-fatal heart attacks + angina/coronary insufficiency.</p>
		
		<a name="cvd"></a>
		
		<h3>Cardiovascular disease (CVD)</h3>
		<p>CVD = coronary heart disease (CHD) + heart failure + strokes + intermittent claudication.</p>
		
		<a name="heart_attack"></a>
		
		<h3>Heart attack</h3>
		<p>Heart attacks = fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarctions.</p>
		<p>Acute, recent, or old - an acute myocardial infarction is defined as the presence of at least two of three findings:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>symptoms indicative of ischemia;</li>
			<li>changes in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis;</li>
			<li>serial changes in the electrocardiograms indicating the evolution of an infarction, including the loss of initial QRS potentials (that is, development of "pathologic" Q-waves of 0.04 second duration or greater).</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Heart failure</h3>
		<p>A minimum of two major or one major and two minor criteria to be present concurrently</p>
		<p>Major Criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or orthopnea;</li>
			<li>Distended neck veins (in other than the supine position);</li>
			<li>Rales;</li>
			<li>Increasing heart size by x-ray;</li>
			<li>Acute pulmonary edema on chest x-ray;</li>
			<li>Ventricular S(3) gallop;</li>
			<li>Increased venous pressure &gt; 16 cm H20;</li>
			<li>Hepatojugular reflux;</li>
			<li>Pulmonary edema, visceral congestion, cardiomegaly shown on autopsy;</li>
			<li>Weight loss on CHF Rx: 10 lbs./5days.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Minor criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bilateral ankle edema;</li>
			<li>Night cough;</li>
			<li>Dyspnea on ordinary exertion;</li>
			<li>Hepatomegaly;</li>
			<li>Pleural effusion by x-ray;</li>
			<li>Decrease in vital capacity by one-third from maximum record;</li>
			<li>Tachycardia (120 beats per minute or more);</li>
			<li>Pulmonary vascular engorgement on chest x-ray.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Intermittent claudication</h3>
		<p>A cramping discomfort in the calf clearly provoked by walking some distance with the pain appearing sooner when walking quickly or uphill and being relieved within a few minutes by rest.</p>
		
		<a name="stroke"></a>
		
		<h3>Stroke</h3>
		<p>A sudden or rapid onset of a focal neurologic deficit persisting for greater than 24 hours AND Transient ischemic event (TIA) = a focal neurologic deficit of sudden or rapid onset that fully resolves in less than 24 hours.
